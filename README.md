Weather app with persisting data and user functionality though firebase/firestore.
In order to run, please use .env variables and run npm install on package.json.

User authentication is done through google services, and you can set your favorite
cities, and find all relevant weather data for any location you'd like. 

As a bonus, the background changes based on the weather / time of day. Thanks for
checking out my project!
